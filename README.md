-> This app has been developed using Flutter SDK and Weather API.
-> I have used Flutter for creating the UI and the the Frontend and have linked it to the weather API for updation of the 
   database.I have used WeatherAPI.com for fetching the data.
-> The App works on location inputs via the drop arrow button, once the location has been entered this app updates the live 
   fetched data through the API.
-> Once, the location is given as an input then the Date & Time, Wind direction, Temperature, Humidity, etc. and all 
   the related data gets updated accordingly!
-> This app also provides with hourly weather updates of 24hours of a day.

-> In order to use the app you can paste your own API in the code.
